Hello,  
Today, we are going to talk about ABV & IBU Exploration of Beers. My name is Jae Chung, a Data Scientist who is an expert in helping companies prosper. As you know, the beer industry is a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, with a wide range of factors that can impact a company's success. I specialize in leveraging data science to help companies or businesses make more informed decisions, drive innovation, and stay ahead of their respective industries. Today, I'd like to share with you some insights I have gathered from a year's worth of data analysis on the breweries and beer industry and what I discovered about the relationship between ABV and IBU.
